/**
 * A base class for custom {@link Condition} implementations in client code.

 * Client code may provide proper {@link Condition} implementations extending
 * this useful base class. All necessary parts of the {@link Condition}
 * interface are already implemented. Only these two methods need further
 * implementation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #toSQL(org.jooq.RenderContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #bind(org.jooq.BindContext)}</li>

 * Refer to those methods' Javadoc for further details about their expected
