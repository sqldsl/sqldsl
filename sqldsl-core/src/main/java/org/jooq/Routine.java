/**
 * A routine is a callable object in your RDBMS.
 * <p>
 * Callable objects are mainly stored procedures and stored functions. The
 * distinction between those two object types is very subtle and not well
 * defined across various RDBMS. In general, this can be said:
 * <p>
 * Procedures:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Are called as callable statements</li>
 * <li>Have no return value</li>
 * <li>Support OUT parameters</li>
 * </ul>
 * Functions
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Can be used in SQL statements</li>
 * <li>Have a return value</li>
 * <li>Don't support OUT parameters</li>
 * </ul>
 * But there are exceptions to these rules:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>DB2, H2, and HSQLDB don't allow for JDBC escape syntax when calling
 * functions. Functions must be used in a SELECT statement</li>
 * <li>H2 only knows functions (without OUT parameters)</li>
 * <li>Oracle functions may have OUT parameters</li>
 * <li>Oracle knows functions that mustn't be used in SQL statements</li>
 * <li>Oracle parameters can have default values (to support this, jOOQ renders
 * PL/SQL instead of the JDBC escape syntax)</li>
 * <li>Postgres only knows functions (with all features combined)</li>
 * <li>The Sybase JDBC driver doesn't handle null values correctly when using
 * the JDBC escape syntax on functions</li>
 * <li>etc...</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Hence, with #852, jOOQ 1.6.8, the distinction between procedures and
 * functions becomes obsolete. All stored routines are simply referred to as
 * "Routine".
