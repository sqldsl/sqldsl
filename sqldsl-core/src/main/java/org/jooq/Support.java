/**
 * A formal declaration of whether any API element is supported by a given
 * {@link SQLDialect}
 * <p>
 * The annotation is mainly used in three modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The annotation is absent on a method. This means that the applied
 * <code>SQLDialect</code> is irrelevant for that method. This is mostly the
 * case for jOOQ's general API (creating factories, rendering SQL, binding
 * variables, etc.) as well as utility methods.</li>
 * <li>The annotation is present but "empty" on a method, i.e. it specifies no
 * <code>SQLDialect</code>. This means that all of jOOQ's dialects are supported
 * by this API method. This is typically the case with jOOQ's SQL construction
 * API for very common clauses, such as the creation of <code>SELECT</code>,
 * <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>.</li>
 * <li>The annotation is present and specifies one or more dialects. A method
 * annotated in such a way should be used only along with any of the dialects
 * specified by the annotation. This is typically the case with jOOQ's SQL
 * construction API for less common clauses, such as the creation of
 * <code>MERGE</code>, etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Future versions of jOOQ may use these annotations for throwing
 * {@link SQLDialectNotSupportedException} where appropriate, or preprocessing
 * jOOQ source code in order to mark unsupported API as {@link Deprecated}
