/**
 * This type is used for the {@link Insert}'s DSL API.
 * <p>
 * Example: <code><pre>
 * DSLContext create = DSL.using(configuration);
 *
 * TableRecord<?> record =
 * create.insertInto(table, field1, field2)
 *       .values(value1, value2)
 *       .returning(field1)
 *       .fetchOne();
 * </pre></code>
 * <p>
 * This implemented differently for every dialect:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Firebird and Postgres have native support for
 * <code>INSERT .. RETURNING</code> clauses</li>
 * <li>HSQLDB, Oracle, and DB2 JDBC drivers allow for retrieving any table
 * column as "generated key" in one statement</li>
 * <li>Derby, H2, Ingres, MySQL, SQL Server only allow for retrieving IDENTITY
 * column values as "generated key". If other fields are requested, a second
 * statement is issued. Client code must assure transactional integrity between
 * the two statements.</li>
 * <li>Sybase and SQLite allow for retrieving IDENTITY values as
 * <code>@@identity</code> or <code>last_inserted_rowid()</code> values. Those
 * values are fetched in a separate <code>SELECT</code> statement. If other
 * fields are requested, another statement is issued. Client code must assure
 * transactional integrity between these statements.</li>
 * </ul>
